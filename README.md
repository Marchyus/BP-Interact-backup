# Why?
Blue Prism Hub/Interact has 10+ components, each of those contains own config file(s). 
Script backups all .json and .config files.

Though mostly it was _"could I do it with .bat?"_

# How to use
Change _line #6_ if interact is not in default directory (_C:\Program Files (x86)\Blue Prism\\_). 

1. Choose directory for backup(s)
2. Copy *backup_interact_configs.bat* there
3. Execute script
